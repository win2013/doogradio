This is the multiplatform-based version of an earlier incarnation of what was originally meant to be a fully-automated icecast radio station server framework.  This included features such as a graphical font "now playing" image generation, randomized playlists from multiple folders, random jingles at specified interval support, and finally, a TTS radio "DJ" which told listeners what songs they were listening to (since originally the stream it was developed for was in-game).

Many of those features are not quite polished off yet in this port, but hopefully putting it up online will make it easier to collaborate with others in bringing it up to feature parity with the original .NET version.

This version was written in Python by Coda, with the replayer written in C.
